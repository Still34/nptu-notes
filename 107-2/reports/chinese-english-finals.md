### The Show

#### **Text Comparison**

>「誰來晚餐」
> ”Guess Who”

#### **Analysis**

「誰來晚餐」 is a reality TV show televised by the Taiwan Public
Television Service Online, in which the guest gets to pick celebrities
that they want and the team would invite one of the people over for 
dinner - the twist is that the chosen celebrity would not be revealed
until after the dinner is prepared. The show heavily focuses on the
day-to-day life and story aspect of an average civilian. Before and
while the meal is being prepared, they would talk about what the
citizen does for their job, what their background is and whatnot.

One aspect of TV programs that a translator must keep in mind is the
fact that the program's name must be short and concise. While one can
directly translate the name to `Who's Coming for Dinner`, it would
not be ideal, as it would be far too long and would not sound very 
elegant. 

Translating the name to `Guess Who` however, retains the
mystery aspect of the show while omitting the dinner part - which is
not exactly important. Because of this, I believe that whoever came
up with the English name for the program did a great job in keeping
the core motto of the show in the title.

### Souvenir vs. Keepsakes

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Text Comparison**
> 「就是紀念以前曾經的過去」
> 
> ”They’re keepsakes from the past.”

#### **Analysis**

> **Definition of "keepsake"**
> 
> noun. Something that one keeps because of the memories it calls to mind.

> **Definition of "souvenir"**
>
> noun. An item of sentimental value, to remember an event or location. 

「紀念」 was used as a verb; however, in the translation, they opted to
use "keepsakes," a noun to indicate a similar meaning.

It's also interesting to note the differences between a "keepsake" and
a "souvenir"; some may only know the word souvenir, as it appears 
more frequently in our day-to-day life.

> [!NOTE]
> "As nouns the difference between keepsake and souvenir is that 
> **keepsake** is some *object given by a person* and retained in 
> memory of something or someone; something kept for sentimental or 
> nostalgic reasons while **souvenir** is *an item of sentimental 
> value*, to remember an event or location."

### In-vogue Yearbook

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Text Comparison**
> 「我覺得那個時候我們大概是在全年級就是最潮流的一個，
> 那個畢業紀念冊的版面設計這樣子。」
> 
> ”Back then, this was considered our entire year's most in-vogue 
> page spread design for the graduation yearbook.”

#### **Analysis**

> **Definition of "vogue"**
> 
> 1. the prevailing fashion or style at a particular time
> 2. general acceptance or favour; popularity

Although the word "vogue" is not archaic, its use was peculiar. As
when discussing anything fashionable, people wouldn't normally
use this word. 

It's also worth noting its usage throughout the last century, where
it peaked during the 1930s, and has since gone downhill over the
years.

#### **Alternative Proposition**

The potential issue of using a less common vocabulary is the risk
of alienating the audience in a sense that only few of those viewers
who had previously seen the word may know or understand its meaning.

By using a more laymen's term or vocabulary, the translation becomes
much more accessible to others. Another thing to keep in mind when
translating is that while the English subtitles are targeted towards
English-speaking viewers, these viewers may not actually speak or read
English very well - but that they had to rely on English as their 
Chinese ability may be less than desirable.

```diff
+ Back then, this was probably considered to be one of the best-designed spread among the others.
- Back then, this was considered our entire year's most in-vogue page spread design for the graduation yearbook.

### Lion's Head

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Text Comparison**
> 「以前就是我媽很愛做獅子頭。」
> 
> ”Mom used to like cooking braised pork balls.”

#### **Analysis**

##### "Lion's Head"

`獅子頭` is a traditional meatball dish that originated in China.
When translating this dish, several translation techniques are
used by people. For example, some may opt to translate the dish
word-by-word, which would yield something like `Lion's Head`. However,
the problem with this approach is that it's difficult to understand
or picture for those who had never seen or eaten the said dish.

An alternative approach is to translate it by its properties. Since
it is basically a *stewed meatball*, some may opt to translate it
as just `meatball`, with additional adjectives describing the dish.

##### Problem with the translated text

In this instance, the translator opted to use `braised pork balls`,
which, in my opinion, isn't necessarily the best approach. More often
than not, Chinese are often associated with eating meat organs and
basically every part of the animal. By using the word `pork balls`,
it could potentially lead to misunderstanding that it's a dish which
testicles (`ball` is often a slang for testicles) are involved.

Therefore, I do believe using `braised meatball` or something along
the line might be better, as `meatball` has a much smaller room for
misinterpretation. 

#### **Alternative Proposition**

```diff
+ Mom used to like cooking braised meatballs.
- Mom used to like cooking braised pork balls.
```

### Sauté

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Text Comparison**
> 「這個一定要爆到很老。」
> 
> ”It needs to be cooked thoroughly.”

#### **Analysis**

「爆香」 is used to describe the act of sautéing; in other words, 
fried quickly in a little hot fat. Due to the nature of this word,
it cannot be translated word-by-word, as it wouldn't make too much
sense to native English-speakers.

In this context, 「爆到很老」 is used to describe that the dish
must be sautéed and cooked thoroughly. While the act of sautéing was
not translated, translating the entire sentence using "cooked
thoroughly" still makes sense, and therefore is acceptable.

### "Gherkin" vs. "Cucumber"

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Text Comparison**
> 「昨天晚上自己拌的小黃瓜。」
> 
> ”I prepared this gherkin salad last night.”

#### **Analysis**

> **Definition of "gherkin"**
> 
> noun. a small prickly fruit used for pickling; a pickle made 
> from this fruit

A gherkin is a different variety of a cucumber and is often pickled,
and is much smaller than a regular cucumber. However, according to
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickled_cucumber), a 
gherkin is only 4~8cm after pickled, which makes it seem unlikely that
a gherkin is actually used here. Furthermore, nowhere did the 
sentence implied that the dish served was indeed a pickled cucumber;
therefore, it might be safer to simply call it a `cucumber salad`,
rather than specifically mentioning a special type of the vegetable.
