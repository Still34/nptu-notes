## Note-taking vs. Dictation

1. Key content words (avoid function words)
2. Use abbreviations & acronyms
3. Paraphrase longer & more complex content
4. Use number & letter system to distinguish main points from sub-points and specific examples
5. Use indentation

An example below illustrate the guidelines above:

```markdown
I. 1st Main Point
    A) 1st Sub Point
        1) 1st Example
        2) 2nd Example
    B) 2nd Sub Point
```

### Tips for Abbreviating

1. Eliminate final letters in long words
   * e.g., `association` = `assoc.`
2. Use entire first syllable but only first letter of second syllable
   * e.g., `subject` = `subj.`
3. Omit vowels in the middle of words bundled by consonants
   * e.g., `background` = `bkgd.`
4. Use apostrophes to represent missing letters
   * e.g.,
   * `government` = `gov't`
   * `continued` = `cont'd`
5. Use symbols to represent whole words
