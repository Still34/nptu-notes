## Chapter 1 - The Importance of Building Relationships (2019/03/04)

### Dangers of Poor Communication

Successful people develop great relationships and use them to build a foundation for success.

> [!TIP]
> In any job or business, relationship building must be your most important objective.
> Quite simple, the quality of the relationship will determine the quality of the product or service.

### Seven Key Factors to Building Great Relationships

1. Be courteous
2. Find common interests
3. Build credibility
4. Make others feel important
5. Show humility
    > [!TIP]
    > If I want to improve my relationships, I must practice humility.
    > It's a strength, not a weakness.
6. Listen actively
7. Be empathetic
   > [!TIP]
   > Think about one of your best relationships at work.
   > Why does it work so well? Why is it successful? Is it because one (or more) of these seven factors?

### Communicating Across Cultures

#### Challenges of Non-native English Writers

The danger is that simple translations could become:

* overcomplicated or wordy
* focused on specific words rather than on the whole meaning
* lacking in any action needed.

Here's a systematic sequence for you to use in your approach:

1. Identify the thought in your own language
2. Translate it into English
3. Convert the thought in English into the correct written English words.
4. Consider if your reader is likely to interpret these words accurately.
5. Reflect on any changes that could be clarified before finalizing.

To avoid or minimize distortions, ask yourself such questions as:

* Will my readers know and understand the words I use?
* Are the words the right words?
* Have I stated the response I expect?
* Will my message achieve the desired results?

#### Keep it Simple

> [!WARNING]
> When texting or emailing friends, or putting posts up on your Facebook
> for friends page, then perhaps abbreviated words are fine, but don't 
> get into the habit of doing this so that you forget to spell out the
> words correctly when necessary.

*How simple is simple?*

#### Remember your ABC

1. Accurate
   * Check fact carefully
   * Include all relevant details
   * Proofread thoroughly
2. Brief
   * Keep sentences short
   * Use simple expressions
   * Use non-technical language
   * Use active voice
3. Clear
   * Use plain simple English
   * Write in an easy natural style
   * Avoid formality

## Chapter 4 - Structuring Messages Logically (2019/03/04)

### Four-point Plan

1. Introduction (Background and Basics)
   * Why are you writing?
   * Refer to a previous letter, contact, or document
   > [!WARNING]
   > You will *not* build relationships if you use introductions like "we spoke" or "as spoken."
   > Say "thanks for your call" or "it was great to speak to you" so that you put some feeling into your message.
2. Details (Facts and Figures)
   * Give information/instructions
   * Ask for information; provide all relevant details
   * Separate into paragraphs; ensure logical flow
3. Response or Action (Conclusion)
   * Action the reader should take/you will take
   * Give a deadline if necessary
4. Close (A Simple One-liner)
   > [!TIP]
   > Make your documents visually appealing and reader-friendly by using headings, numbered points and bullets where appropriate. 
   > Take care when using bullets to make sure each point is written in parallel style.
   > Read more about using bullets and lists in Chapter 16. (Might not be available in notes?)
