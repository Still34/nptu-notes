#### **Original text**

The most comprehensive report to assess the gender gap in American schools found widespread bias against girls in tests, textbooks, and teaching practices – findings that set off an immediate controversy among educators.

"The bias that exists in how girls are taught is no longer blatant, but they experience it on a daily basis," said Sharon Schuster, president of the American Association of University Women (AAUW), which commissioned the report.

The Education Department, which last month proposed eliminating the only federal program aimed at promoting educational equity for girls, said the new report lacked perspective and hard data and maintained yesterday that gender-equity programs were no longer needed.

Ravitch cited statistics showing the percentage of female high school graduates enrolling in college is now larger than males and that the number of women who become lawyers, doctors and other professionals is rapidly increasing.

一份調查美國校園性別差距的詳盡報告指出，校園中不論在考試、教科書、教學實踐中，皆有對女性的偏見。此事一出立即引發各界教育者的爭議。

提出此調查的美國婦女學院學會執行長沙倫修特指出 ：「教導女孩時所見的偏見不再單單存在，而是已經耳濡目染、習以為常。」

上個月提出撤除改善女性教育權國家法案的美國教育部指控該調查缺乏適當觀點與可靠數據，並且堅決不再需要任何性別平等計畫。

黛安拉維奇以數據指出申請大學的女性高中畢業生數量已超過男性，且選擇律師、醫師相關職業的女性數量已攀升許多，但數量再高也無法真正顯現出公平性。根據美國勞動部調查，兩性仍有同工不同酬的現象。與男性賺取整整一美元相比，女性僅能賺取其中的69分錢。
